# Smart-Predictive-Modeling-for-Rental-Property-Prices

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the features and historical rental prices data, handling missing  
values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
Identify key features that significantly influence rental prices. Perform feature
engineering to create new informative features, such as proximity scores to important  
facilities.

4. Model Selection:
Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, such as linear regression,  
decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Consider
ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.

6. Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training
data. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error,
mean absolute error) on the testing data.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

10. Interpretability and Explainability:
Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the predicted
rental prices. Provide insights into how specific features impact rental prices.
